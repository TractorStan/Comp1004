Whetherforks is a Restaurant Management System specifically designed to be used throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, to keep restaurant goers safe and ergo keep the hospitality industry alive through these stressful times. The system is specifically for customers coming into a restaurant, caf√© or any other hospitality venues such as pubs. 

Firstly, the system will collect their phone number and name. After the owner has entered in the details about the venue, customers will be able to book a table, selecting the time they want and how many people are coming. However, if the number of people entered is above the government guidelines, an alert is raised. If it turns out that a customer attended the venue but then tested positive for coronavirus, all the customers around that time will be sent a text, advising them to self-isolate. Without such a system, potential positive patients would not isolate and continue to spread the virus.

In short:
For the hospitality Industry,
Whose business has crumbled down due to the Covid-19 pandemic,
The Whetherforks: Restaurant Management System
Is a track and trace amplifier specifically tailored to restaurant venues
That prevents the additional spread of Covid-19 by alerting previous customers if a positive patient attended their venue at the same time as them, encouraging them to get a test and isolate. Without such a system, potential positive patients would not isolate and continue to spread the virus.
