WhetherForks: Restaurant Management System

Introduction
This document is solely for recognising what the system will do, and what the system requires from us in exchange. The system itself is to be used by customers coming into a restaurant, café or any other hospitality venues such as pubs. Firstly, the system will collect their phone number and name. After the owner has entered in the details about the venue, customers will be able to book a table, selecting the time they want and how many people are coming. However, if the number of people entered is above the government guidelines, an alert is raised. If it turns out that a customer attended the venue but then tested positive for coronavirus, all of the customers around that time will be sent a text, advising them to self-isolate.

The purpose of the following sections will provide an accurate portrayal of all the required elements that will lead to a top quality project, as well as the skills I already have that will be useful in its development.

Existing Skills
I’ve had many part-time jobs that have given me essential life skills:

During the summer of 2020, I was able to make a direct difference for the potential and confirmed victims of the Covid-19 Virus by being a leading employee at the Plymouth Coronavirus Test Centre for over 2 months (University being the main reason I could not work longer). This gave me tremendous experience in the field of the current pandemic, allowing me to understand what people want to hear in order to soothe their concerns and the importance of safety among those of us in the hospitality industry. I know how important a system like this is for the currently suffering hospitality industry, as every restaurants main concern should be that their patrons are safe, and that if there is a positive case then that everyone who has visited afterwards should be informed.

Alongside that part-time job, I also worked in all departments of Marks and Spencer during the latter half of 2019: Menswear, Ladieswear, Customer support, Home and lastly, Café. Even though it is obvious that working in the café would give me essential skills, working in the other departments also gave me very valuable skills. I was able to take initiative in several occasions which gave me leadership qualities as well as time management.

Aside from part-time employment, I also did Computer Science and IT in A-level. Here, I learnt more in 1 and a half years about computing than I ever have. I mainly learnt Python, but I also learnt a little about HTML and how to create a basic web application. Alongside Programming languages, I am well informed on several life cycle processes such as Waterfall and Agile, which is the process used in this project. With all this prior experience, I know all my existing skills will ensure that this project is a success, and that I am perfect for this role.

Required Skills
The most obvious skills that are required from me would have to be to have knowledge in web design using HTML/CSS/ JavaScript along with ASP.NET Core and a JavaScript SDK. Acknowledging the deadline longevity as well as my Existing Skill above, I should be able to learn all the necessary language techniques in that amount of time to create a suitable web application for my client.

Alongside the obvious requirements, whoever is to create the web application will need several attributes to make sure it runs smoothly. They will need to make sure they can understand their client and aren’t afraid to ask for more feedback if necessary. They should also be able to take initiative and strategize/plan on the spot in order to ensure all the required features can still be implemented despite any unforeseen, inevitable problems occur.
