Project Vision
For [who?] - For the hospitality Industry,

Whose [problem] - Whose business has crumbled down due to the Covid-19 pandemic,

The [name of your product] - The Whetherforks: Restaurant Management System

Is a [type of product] - Is a track and trace amplifier specifically tailored to restaurant venues

That [what are the key reasons] - That prevents the additional spread of Covid-19 by alerting previous customers if a positive patient attended their venue at the same time as them, encouraging them to get a test and isolate. Without such a system, potential positive patients would not isolate and continue to spread the virus.


Whetherforks is a Restaurant Management System specifically designed to be used throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, to keep restaurant goers safe and ergo keep the hospitality industry alive through these stressful times. The system is specifically for customers coming into a restaurant, café or any other hospitality venues such as pubs. 

Firstly, the system will collect each customer’s phone number/Email address and name, even if they are attending as a group. After the owner (or a trained employee) has entered in the details about the venue, customers will be able to choose what venue they’ll be attending, book a table, select how many people are coming and choose what time they will be arriving. 

If the number of attendees entered is above the maximum number according to the current government guidelines, an alert is raised. If it turns out that a customer, that had previously attended the venue, was positive for Covid-19, all the customers around the time that they attended will be sent a text, advising them to self-isolate and take a test if possible. Without such a system, potential positive patients would not isolate and continue to spread the virus to more and more victims.
